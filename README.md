# Experiment Names 
- Assignment Experiment-1
- Assignment Experiment-2
- Assignment Experiment-3

### Assignment Experiment-1
In this project:
- An object detection model trained on Colab and The model YoloV8 used for training.
- Data was separated as train, test and validation (%70 used for training, %20 used for validation and lastly %10 used for test).
- Data Augmentation wasn't added.
- The model trained for 300 epochs.

Parameters that I used:
- lr: 0.01
- optimizer: SGD
- image size: 640x640
- device: GPU
- batch size: 2
- epochs = 300


### Assignment Experiment-2 (Will be Added)
